# tic-tac-toe

## Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! 
This is a simple, text-based version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built with Python. It's a fun, interactive game where two players can take turns to mark spaces in a 3x3 grid with either X or O, aiming to get three in a row to win.

## Game Features
**Two-Player Mode:** Designed for two players to take turns.

**Grid Display:** A clear, text-based 3x3 grid display.

**Win Detection:** Checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins.

**Draw Detection:** Recognizes when all spaces are filled and declares a draw if thereâ€™s no winner.

## How to Play
**Run the script:** Start the game by running tic_tac_toe.py.
**Take Turns:** Players will be prompted to enter a combination of rows and columns coordinates (a-c for rows and 1-3 for columns) where they would like to place their mark (X or O).
**Win or Draw:** The game will display a message if a player wins or if there is a draw.

## Running the Game
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-python.git
cd tic-tac-toe-python

2. Run the game using Python:

python tic_tac_toe.py

## Code Overview
**main.py:** Initialize the game
**tic_tac_toe.py:** Contains all logic for the game, including the board display, player turns, and win/draw detection.

## Future Enhancements
Some ideas for expanding this project:

**Single-Player Mode:** Add a computer opponent with different difficulty levels.
**GUI Version:** Create a graphical interface for a more interactive experience.
**Score Tracking:** Track wins, losses, and draws across multiple games.
